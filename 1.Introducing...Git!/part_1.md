### What is Git ? 
*  **VCS** (stands for: **Version Control System**) :
	
* Version control is software that tracks and *manages changes* to files over time.
	
* VCS generally allow users to revisit earlier versions of the files, compare changes between versions, undo changes and a whole lot more...
	
* Git is just one of many VCS available today. (Subversion, CVS, Mercurial)
	
* In Git we can add checkpoint like save in video game and can back to checkpoint every time we want . (and other things ...)
